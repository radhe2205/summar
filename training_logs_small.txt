00:56:00,217 root INFO <start> this method is much easier to do with an artificial tree as you can disassemble it and get at the roots of the branches . however , if you want a more illuminated tree and you have a real tree , its possible its just more work . put all the branches in front of you , categorized by where they go on the tree . you will be starting with the branches that line the bottom . , putting in only the bottom row makes it easier to line each branch with lights . start at the base of one branch , wrap up to its tip , and back down to its root . keep doing this around each branch on the bottom . make sure the lights stay on the sides of the branch by really nestling them in there , or taking the strand and forming into a loop that you can place around the greens . make sure the strands are snug on the tree and press them together if need be . the beauty of the artificial tree is that it is totally mold - able . , once every branch on the bottom is lined up and down , assemble the next level of the tree . then , take your strand and move it up to the next set of branches , weaving back and forth like you just did , up and down , moving around and around . if you notice the lights are coming loose , you can wrap them around the branch , too . however , this takes a bit more of the length of the set , and you may be short at the top ( unless you have plenty of lights to spare ) . , as the tree gets smaller and smaller , youll need fewer lights . unless you want it brighter at the top , make sure youre using the same ratio of lights as you did on the bottom . as the tree gets thinner and thinner , your lighting work will be more and more visible . take extra time toward the top to make sure your tree is as beautiful as possible . , if some branches seem dimmer or brighter than others , adjust the lights as necessary , bringing them out to pop or nestling them in to be a bit dimmer . you may need to adjust the placement of the branches , too the one obstacle of the artificial tree . make sure to test your lights in all different forms of lighting . turn your house lights off and look at the tree ; then , turn the house lights on . experiment with all the settings on your strands if applicable , and take a minute to refine it to your tastes . it will be worth it this is the centerpiece of christmas after all . <end>

01:28:08,115 root INFO <start> when inspecting your cats nails , look for any signs of damage , infection , or other problems . nail health is important to overall hygiene , as an infection of the nail can quickly spread to other parts of your cats body . look to see if the nails are intact . observe to see if their claws are jagged , have been torn , or are missing pieces . see if there is any fungus present you may spot green , black , or yellow growth around the claws or pads . , after inspecting their nails , you may need to systemically clean them . this is especially true if you notice fungus , other growth , or any sort of damage to their nails . dip their feet in warm water . gently dislodge all dirt , fungus , or other debris on the claws . if your cat has claw fungus , you should consult your vet . your vet will likely advise you to continue to wash their feet in warm water . in addition , they may prescribe a topical antifungal or another cleaning agent . , trimming your cats claws is a key part of maintaining proper hygiene for indoor cats . this is important , as many indoor cats dont have the ability to wear their claws down as they would outside . thus , their claws may grow long and may accumulate bacteria . however , when trimming your cats claws , make sure to use a proper cat claw trimmer . position your trimmer perpendicular to the claw and along the transparent part of it . make sure to avoid blood vessels . quickly cut the transparent part of the claw . if youre afraid youll hurt your cat , trim just the tip of the claw . after you trim the tip , you can move up higher and take more of the nail off . if your cat does not respond well to nail trimming , you may need to have your vet do it . clip one or two claws at a time . trying to get a whole foot or even all your cats feet might be too much to expect . , a cats quick is the portion of its claw where there is tissue and blood vessels . if you cut their quick , youll cause them pain and may expose them to the dangers of infection . thus , you need to be very careful not to cut their quick . always cut less nail than you need . if you cut the quick , consider using a silver nitrate applicator to stop blood loss . youll take the applicator and apply it to the area that is bleeding . regardless of whether you use silver nitrate or not , the wound should stop bleeding in 5 minutes or so . <end>

02:32:24,487 root INFO <start> go for 70 % or higher for the most nutritional value . you will receive the most antioxidants at this level . studies show that chocolate and chocolate bars with 70 % cacao or higher provide the highest levels of antioxidants , fiber , magnesium , and copper as well . if you are not a big fan of bitter or intense chocolate , go for 70 % cacao maximum . higher levels may not be very enjoyable to your taste buds . in addition , if it is over 70 % it is considered dairy free as there are is no milk or milk solids in this type of chocolate . , the level of antioxidants present in chocolate depends on the quality of the ingredients and the processing techniques . it is better to buy organic chocolate if you are looking for the most nutritious type . cocoa bean farming uses some highest quantities of pesticides . cocoa beans are known as one of the highest " contaminated " products with the largest amount of pesticide residue . look for organic labeling on your chocolate . it should say " organic " or " 100 % organic " on the label . only an 100 % organic label indicates that all ingredients used in the chocolate are organic . , in addition to choosing organic chocolates , also consider only purchasing chocolates that have the seal of being fairly traded . cocoa farmers are often forced to sell products to middlemen for very low prices . in addition , many of these middle men have been associated with child labor . if you purchase a chocolate with the label of fair traded on it , it means that the company ensures that farmers receive an appropriate price for their product , are allowed to invest in farming techniques that allow for a better flavor and cocoa bean and strictly prohibits child labor . many times the farming practices and techniques of fair trade chocolate make a better quality chocolate as well . , not all chocolates are created equal . it is important to read over the labels of any chocolate you buy so you know what it contains . as mentioned , true chocolate should contain cocoa butter as one of the ingredients . this is what makes chocolate smooth , creamy and delicious . however , some chocolate and candy companies use other types of fats in their chocolates . read over the ingredient list and look for other types of fats like hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils . these are processed , trans - fats that have negative effects on your health . however , they are cheaper to use so companies will sometimes use these instead of the cocoa butter . <end>

04:41:02,929 root INFO <start> after finishing your tattoo , most artists will wash the area with mild soap , apply an antiseptic ointment , and cover your tattoo with a bandage to help prevent infection . depending on the size of your tattoo , this bandage may be gauze , medical bandaging , or even plastic wrap . this bandage should be removed after 4 to 6 hours . this will allow your skin to breathe , which is essential for the tattoo ' s healing . showering with this bandage still in place can soak the bandage and hold too much water against your tattoo . ; , after removing the bandage , your tattoo will likely be covered with adhesive , ointment , and dried blood . this mixture should be washed away before you shower . use a very mild soap ( such as liquid hand soap ) and water to clean the tattoo . use only your fingers to lightly massage the soap onto your skin ; do not use a cloth and do not scrub - this can easily abrade your skin and result in scarring . gently pat the area dry with a cloth when finished . , after getting tattooed , you should try to wait at least 48 hours before you shower to give your new tattoo time to form a protective barrier , but sometimes it is unavoidable . for the first week or so - especially the first few days - after getting your new tattoo , you will need to follow specific rules in the shower . run your shower with cool or lukewarm water . this is helpful for 2 reasons : it prevents the stinging pain that hot water would cause on your fresh tattoo , and it prevents your pores from opening too wide . hot water will cause your skin ' s pores to open , which can lead to loss of pigment . as an added precaution , consider running cold water indirectly over your fresh tattoo for the last 30 seconds of your shower to close your pores . do not allow the stream of water to hit your tattooed skin directly . when rinsing , let the water wash over your tattoo indirectly . this will help prevent scarring or puckering of your skin . take as brief a shower as possible . your tattoo will heal better if it is minimally exposed to steam , water , and soap . hold your tattooed skin out of the water as much as possible during the shower . , after showering , you should dry your tattoo as quickly as possible . using a clean towel , gently pat your tattooed skin dry . do not use a rubbing motion , and do not allow your tattoo to slowly air dry . dry the rest of your body as usual . <end>
